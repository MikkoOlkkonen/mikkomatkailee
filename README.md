An Instagram-like web app made with React, Node and MongoDB.

Includes basic features of instagram such as posting, commenting,
liking, disliking, viewing profiles and notifications.
Navigating the app is smooth with sliding transitions for example.
Viewing the app requires creating an account but it is stupid simple and fast (I mean it)

Available at mikkomatkailee.fly.dev
Mobile standalone PWA app is suggested
